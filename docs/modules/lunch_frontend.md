# [Add-on] [Outputs a folder that follows a frontend project structure] Frontend Front — lunch-front: IDE for unified & visual Frontend Development for the React Ecossystem (NextJS, React Native, Electron). 

## AI-powered Frontend platform. Cross-platform (web, mobile, desktop) react-based visual development.

- Compiles to electron project (for desktop), or expo project (for mobile), or a nextjs project (for dynamic websites) or static html/css/js files (for static sites) and has invisable gitops. Support for any nextjs or static html deployment cloud/targets such as Freelunch, Vercel, Netlify or NGINX.
- platform-specific add-ons (with visual diffing of platform-specific stuff) (typescript packages are tagged with their platform support, ideally if the package cna be cross-lpatform it shoudl be)
- write api-calling code in typescript/javascript + non-api calling code any other language (Rust, etc) and automatically get the code you wrote in the other languages compiled to WASM and linked to the typescript/javascript code
- gitops-based
- built-in design system
- component ownership/organization/visualization/testing
- built-in device emulator with user-action-based debugger (runs a debugger on code triggered by user action)
- Visibility into backend functions available for frotend to consume + frontend-backend http communication abstracted away with decorators
- declarative auth with decorators
- unified primitives across web, mobile, desktop
  - filesystem API
  - databases APIs
  - routing/navigation
  - declarative analuytics via decorators tha you put on objects (via DSL backwards-compatible with Typescript)
- remote dev container (for frontends that require GPU)
- static media assets management: svg, png, jpeg, gif, mp4, etc
- block-based performanc profiling (component FPS, renders, memory, and bundle impact)
- session replay with profiling
- auto visual exploration of possible frontend states, with visualization of states mdoificiton logic via state machine diagram generated automatically (with affected components for each state)
- IDE made for making GUIs (where you define building blocks in the screen of the emulated device and code inside them with splaces for state, config, jsx, data fetching typescript, hook typescript; also navigate your screens according to your defined navigation schema). No-code drag&drop configurable & responsive building blocks with code that can be edited later, Besides building blocks, can also make block decorators, these are perks that modify the behaviour of blocks by overrriding/adding some aspects of the blocks it is applied (e.g., dark mode, font change, add button iside it, etc). Blocks can read and write to global state or cutom-defined higher level state chared by blocks. Separate box for writing global state. Seaparate tabs for coding backgrounds workers.
- marketplace of blocks (each block is responsive, will automatically fit into the layout rectangle designeted for it) & decorators
- CMS widgets for pushing new content artifacts (e.g., modifyng title)
- Fallback to traditional IDE layout
- Codegen end-to-end playwright tests from test annotated frontend code
- AI-assistance at every step (template genration/explanation, component generation/explanation, GUI testing).
  - can give feedback by drawing rectangles, recording the rectangles and writing text feedback on top of it (e.g., showing that a button is not working correctly because it opens up a pop up that is not centralized on the screen)
